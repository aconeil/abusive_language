They ARE SOB's for disrespecting dead soldiers & their families who have lost them. If you disagree, then take the time to ask their families who have lost someone. Ask Taya Kyle (Chris Kyle's wife). I'm sure she'd love to set you straight. 2.) No, they do not have the right to protest whatever they want. Would you protest for the unfair treatment of pedophiles? Of course not. Having the right to protest, doesn't mean you SHOULD. If you are going to protest police brutality, then use the correct forum. Not the Anthem. It borders, IMHO, on treason. It is rude and disrespectful and unless you missed it, America doesn't like it. Unless you are Antifa, of course.

Your proposal is stupidly punitive, singling out a group whose actions benefit our society and automobile drivers.  3) Colorado's image as an outdoor recreation Mecca, which includes being a cycling friendly state, is a huge economic draw.

Could be why I've seen three different counts and breakdowns, including yours, for 2015 in just the past two days.  The one I really like is how cops somehow don't KNOW the 'race' of about one in five of their victims.  Did they explode when they were shot?  Catch fire?  Disintegrate?  Melt?

The success of a tax is if it is widespread, can be enforced easily and is paid by those who actually purchase goods and services. The fewer collectors of a tax the better, and there are much fewer businesses to collect a sales tax than there are residents, who may or may not honestly pay an income tax There are a LOT of income tax cheaters and to enforce collection of income tax requires a new State agency. Auditing businesses who collect sales tax is very straightforward and very few businesses of any size cheat on sales taxes. As a person increases their income, they buy more expensive items, therefore they pay more sales tax, Most states eliminate groceries from sales tax, so as to not unfairly hit the poor, so the sales tax is on items people CHOOSE to buy. Rich people buy planes, expensive cars, expensive homes, expensive """"toys"""", remodel homes, buy new appliances, etc. and therefore pay more sales tax.

The conservatives love to blame the VII clergy for the abuse. (It wasn't.) But the one thing that cannot be denied is that the cover up was perpetrated by JPII / Benedict's men.

Then Bannon spewed out some word salad for Trump to further butcher in an attempt to deny it. They came up with the empty 'isolationism' that Trump immediately denied when he met with Merkel. Trump never had any foreign policy, other than looking to skim money wherever he could. He's a petty con man, not an actual reasoned or sane human being, he's a fraud. He's imbalanced, unfit for office. Now we have a weak and insecure, belligerent child who imagines himself a fascist saviour. He's no more than an egotistical juvenile buffoon.

I listened to it with Beck and the FEMA camps, and it happened again and again through the entire Obama administration.  As for the idiots on college campuses, that is a whole other bag of poo, the kids there can't seem to understand free speech.  Bear in mind, though that just because you have a right to say something doesn't mean that you will find an audience that doesn't think you a fool.

The idiot contributed nothing to public life or the common good. His existence depended on the skill and labor of others; he was a leech sucking the lifeblood from the social body. Related to this, idiocy (from the root idios, 'one’s own') was the state of a private or self-centered person. This contrasted with the status of the public citizen, or polites, such that to be an idiot was to be withdrawn, isolated and selfish, to not participate in the public, political life of the city-state. In Greek society, the condition of idiocy was seen as peculiar and strange (a meaning that is retained in the English word 'idiosyncratic'); thus 'idiot' was a term of reproach and disdain. ...""""

Transfer wealth from the poor to the very wealthy. 50K a year if you earn 1M Yet the right blames the left for not helping kill Obamacare. If the left met the right halfway, Obamacare would be dead.

5642,1,"As I said, I find both Trump and Clinton unpalatable. I supported Bernie Sanders in the primary, because his views are sympathetic to me. However, Trump actively frightens me, and I loathe what he stands for as well. I can see Trump getting into a war through ignorance and personal pique. I do not see Clinton doing that.  Most of all, Trump actually repudiates Christianity. He embraces racism. He sees women as sex objects -- he said that one of the women who accused him of groping was """"too ugly"""" for him to consider doing that. This is apparently a serious response to the accusation. He does not stand for any sort of moral values.  I question the values of the so-called Christian leaders who support Trump. They are actually hurting their own churches. After this election, in which so many Christians in the US have behaved so very badly, who would ever want to darken the door of one of their churches again?

Such regimes must be destroyed as quickly and as completely as possible: all, who are employed by the government are fair targets, especially those in the military and police services of such regimes. They are to be killed on sight, whenever possible.. Every day such regimes exist, they murder.  Those, who stand by, while such murders occur, are complicit. The U.S. and the Russian Federation have been complicit in the murders committed by Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. The U.S., Russia, China, and the European Union for decades have been complicit in the murders committed by Kim Jong-Eun and his equally genocidal predecessors.

The Conservatives felt it unnecessary to specifically mention Islamophobia.  For Minister Joly to then insinuate that the Conservatives are in favour of hatred is disingenuous at best and a complete misrepresentation at worst.

A Muslim who rejects Islam is an “apostate” and the punishment for apostasy is death (and eternal damnation in hell thereafter). Under sharia, it is forbidden for anyone to try to convert a Muslim to another religion.  When Islam is doubted or defamed in any way, Muslims should violently defend it.  Muslims consider all non-Muslims and non-Muslim culture useless and see their goal to make the whole world Muslim. Everything before Islam is jahiliyya or ignorance, of no value and should be destroyed.   Under Islam, non-Muslims must pay a large tax. Once Muslims conquer a country and convert the government to Islamic law, non-Muslims have the choice to convert or die. However, Christians, Jews, and some Zoroastrians have the choice between becoming Muslim or becoming a dhimmi.   Read Bat Ye'or's publication Eurabia.

The """"Sanctuary City"""" concept is one adopted and embraced by law enforcement, for the purpose of enhancing law enforcement capabilities.  The theory goes, if elements of the community are hesitant to call on law enforcement, report crime, or simply engage due to fears of immigration related consequences, law enforcement becomes ineffective as to a portion of the population.

16329,1,"Khadr decided to stay in the compound even after women and children left - and the compound was engaged after the US interpreter was assassinated at point blank range by one of the Taliban cowards inside.  Khadr was filmed building IED's - he is a traitor and is owed nothing - the fact that he was allowed to return to Canada after fighting for the Taliban is a national disgrace, he had spent a total of 15 months in Canada prior to his capture and is a Canadian of convenience. Khadr's terrorist father got out of a Pakistani prison by using his Canadian 'get out of jail free passport', and promptly returned to terrorism. The entire Khadr family is a stain on the nation - they are not Canadians.

16330,1,"I couldn't agree with you less. What made this 'event' such a 'flashpoint' is the continued arrogant, out of touch  behavior demonstrated by the current Premier of BC toward the people and communities in this province. This was a micro snap of the way in which Clark and her colleagues react to the many serious and life threatening issues facing British Columbians. Our staggering poverty rate, 2nd highest poverty rate of children in this country, the housing crisis,  the fentanyl/ opiod crisis, the never ending scandals within this government, environmental issues including the Site C damn which will cost British Columbians millions and is not needed according to experts, our legal aid cuts, our over-flowing prisons........perhaps you get my point.  Any politician has to be prepared to hear from voters what they don't like or want changed, especially during an election.

There are faux-meat dishes in Asian restaurants that have just as long of a history as the meat-equivalent dishes themselves. To say that seitan has to be 100% like beef is ridiculous.  Second, as many have pointed out, the point of a sloppy or diner food joint catering to vegans is because vegans don't SIMPLY PREFER BROCCOLI - they have cravings for oily, rich, and textured foods other than vegetables the same as meat eaters. The reason they eat non-meat things is for ETHICAL reasons. They refuse to continue to support killing living and pain-feeling beings for the sake of TASTE.

Khan refuses to support implementing any of the common sense measures such as refusing entry to Britain to those who support Sharia Law or have fought for Daesh in Syria.  Khan also has no problem with the practices of Islamic segregation in Britain -- e.g. special sections of libraries and airports reserved for Muslims.  Imagine if there were special sections of public places reserved for Catholics or Jews.  Khan's approach is one of creative appeasement.  He claims to have post-facto sleepless nights, but he is not identifying and dealing with the Salman Abedi's, Khalid Masood's, Khuram Shazads, et al.  As was the case with Chamberlain, appeasement toward those who would destroy you is disastrous.  And that's exactly the problem with Khan's approach.  He believes that appeasement is the answer and it isn't.

All other states he won were more or less leaning republican, even Florida, North Carolina, we could see that most years, they do have a republican bias.  Trump hammered the same message to those 5 states repeatedly in his rallies.  The media refused to acknowledge that he had any message, and only covered the choice awkward or un-PC soundbites.  And hence he was able to show his crowd that the media was against him.  Viewed from a worldwide view, Trump is part of a global wave that is pushing back against inept leaderships in western democracies.

Even though her actions - getting drunk and running over a person with a vehicle - affected other people's lives irrevocably, her life was merely inconvenienced for a few months. This scumbag changed a little girls life, I'm sure he'll get the maximum sentence.  Of course, the accused is a pedophile, not a pretty white girl.  Still, I wouldn't hold my breath for maximum sentencing.

19848,1,"nonsense ................ Obama placed strong sanctions on Russia
"
19881,1,"Oh, please... disgusting is a relative term, Alceste. Promotion of 'misogyny' by phony righteous inglorious behaviour is construed by many to be 'disgusting'.  Who are you to make such a claim of indignancy, friend. Summers has a point.
"
19889,1,"The short form of the article:  Trudeau lied to get elected, is spending our future taxes like a drunk out on the town, and has no idea if we are getting any value in return for the spending.  And our children will be screwed paying for it all.
"
19895,1,"And what lesson did parents teach their kids by voting for a nasty corrupt thrice-married racist misogynistic anti-science bully who is totally inexperienced and unfit to be POTUS? MSW speaks of Manners? Please.
"
19898,1,"I can only shake my head.  The notion that masculinity is toxic is ludicrous.  Masculinity covers a wide range of behaviour, some of it quite beneficial, some it quite the opposite.  One could argue that many of the advances in our society are a direct result of the masculine behaviour of taking risks in the pursuit of knowledge or other gain.  There are certainly some men that exhibit extremely anti-social behaviour, such as described in the article.  To then generalize by stating that all masculine behaviours are anti-social is demeaning to all men who behave themselves.
"
19938,1,"What a ridiculous opinion article. Why is she such a racist and assume that 'black America' is a monolithic block that votes and thinks the same way? How about the 10% of 'blacks' who voted for Trump? Why does she think some politicians like Lewis or Obama are beyond scrutiny and can't be criticized?
"
19949,1,"Indeed.  And wingnuts look at you crazy when you talk about government subsidizing business.

19976,1,"This article by this vapid """"journalist """" is a breathtaking example of how low this paper has gone to publish such utterly biased trash!
"
19980,1,"This cant be real, can it? You think you have heard and seen it all but then all of a sudden this, just sick peope we have in this country!
"
19988,1,"What did I make? You are the one claiming logic and then misusing it.  Few people ever make the mistake of calling me Liberal - but easy to see why someone who struggles with thinking might do so.  As A K says further down """"I find it amusing that you think the President being a lying, egomaniacal imbecile has anything to do with left vs. right.""""
"
19998,1,"These were separate events,  genius. Try reading next time. A trump supporter murdered a guy,  and you just shrug it off. Disgusting.
